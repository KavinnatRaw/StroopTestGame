# StroopTestGame

## Hello! Welcome to my small final project repositories. My name is Kavinnat Rawanggij, but you could either call me Noell or Non. I'm a digital engineering student from Thailand.

Stroop Test Game is based on neuropsychological test called Stroop Color Word Test (SCWT). The objective is simple: identify the **TRUE COLORS** of the text, not the displayed color names, to challenge your perception. It's worth mentioning that there is a secret feature; when answering quickly, the timer freezes, allowing you to score without worrying about the ticking time bomb for a second!

*PS. This Java project is part of my Object-oriented Programming Laboratory course in the 2/2020 academic year of my freshman year at Sirindhorn International Institute of Technology, Thailand.*
